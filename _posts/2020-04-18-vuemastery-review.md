I decided to give the web education tool a try, and it's highly recommended by me. For what it's worth.

My new jobs main application is written entirely in nuxt app. I will admit there's a lot going on and I couldn't jump in and do feature work. I was able to fix a bug and work on a smaller feature.

The courses basics start off easy, and straightforward, watching in 2x speed makes it a breeze and there was only a few times where I had to rewind.
What is nice is that the courses increase in complexity and explain concepts in great detail.
The nuxt tutorial is really good and I highly recommend it, and I am almost tempted to subscribe for a month to finish off the Advanced concepts and other courses. If you are a beginner, this is pretty comprehensive and will not only take you through developing your first application, but developing a full blown web application. I am a fan of Greg Pollack and his teaching styles, however I feel that other than a crash course, most of the material is learnable via just grokking it. For example most of my problems I encountered were primarily my debugging of typescript or some of the esoteric features of vue. This has a lot of value, but the material is definitely aimed at junior and early level developers. The advanced topics are enticing, but there's plenty of free resources to learn most of it (or you can go down at a lower level too).

All in all, recommended if you are looking to learn Vue, free is great or speed run it through a month.
