Today I learned a valuable lesson. Always use version control at the earliest convenience. This does not mean that at every hour push a commit to github, but rather when you are finished with a large segment of code, don't forget to commit and push. Commits within a group setting where the code is more fast paced obviously means that commits are faster, but for personal projects, a commit one every few hours and when a feature has been flesh. I am experiencing the sinking feeling of losing 4 hours worth of work because I didn't push to a version control system. This is because my trusty 4 year old computer has been breathing its last breaths. I am on a new one at this moment and loving every moment of it.
