I have been working on a hugo starter repository to share with people, I really like the layout and the cli is really clean.
It seems like a good alternative to Jekyll.

I really don't have much to say, the repo speaks for itself.
The documentation is great, but the process it wants you to take is pretty manual, so for those who just want to get started asap, I made it easy to start the project from reading the single readme or just download the cli and the project to hit the ground running.
