Recently my mind hasn't been focused on coding as there was a few other complicated life situations that came up.
My momentum has been entirely halted. I'm thinking of projects I can take up so that I can start building up a semblance of momentum. I'm pushing back my plans to go back to graduate school a quarter at least as I've lost a lot of time due to my life situations.

## Project ideas:

### Game

My brother has become interested in learning some basics in programming, and also potentially working on a project together. He's not into committing to long term projects so not sure how it'll pan out. But he has a few ideas and I have a few MVP ideas that would be really fun to tinker with. The biggest point in game dev I see is that it offers plenty of opportunities to optimize code and get better. A nice caveat is that it's a lot more fun to test than something like the applications I work on (albeit I love working on the nitty gritty and trying to make it function better).

### Go service

'Back-end' work, I really like the language and the concurrency concept is top-notch. I program in Go almost daily, but using some of the more advanced features and libraries would be a plusl

### Rust service

'Back-end' work, I really like Rust as a language and thinking of doing a Godot project as it is supported by the game engine's team.

### Elm App

Something simple, probably work on Elm alongside another aspect.

### React App

Something that I can show for myself, probably mix in with a Fire Emblem calculator.

### Hack Gitbook

I really like gitbook, but hate that it's a paid service. I'm planning on looking at the code and figuring out what I can pull out of it so that I can create content and piggyback off the open source code. Hate that it's migrating to json, but mixing it with github pages content would be really cool.

### Hack Ghost

A node application that utilizes a lot of Express. Would be fun to host my own blog and add features that really make it stand out.

### Gatsby Up something

This can be done with another project. Something to learn and tinker with.

### Fire Emblem Calculators purely running on Github

Tech stack is simple, utilitize github's raw files to serve up csv or other simple text formats.
Use this and some front-end library to create a nice little niche application.

### Learn C++ with game programming

I have a book, and there's lots of tutorials online. Might as well give this a shot.
