This seems like it could be a no brainer for some people but I was puzzled on this today for a few hours, hence I'm going to be talking about it. Clang.<!--more--> So I'm used to using clang to build and link C files, and I am starting to work on C++ just for personal learning as well as to spruce up my skills in C languages. I was having trouble figuring out how to get C++ files linked and it was because I was using `clang` rather than `clang++`.

For C: `clang <arguments> <files> -o <bin name>`
For C++: `clang++ <arguments> <files> -o <bin name>`
For Obj-C: `clang <arguments> <files> -o <bin name>`

Notice that Objective-C is the same as C, this is because Objective-C is a superset language of C. Meaning it expands and enhances the features of C rather than is another language that borrow elements of the former.
