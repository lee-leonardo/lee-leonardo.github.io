Today I focused on restoring the previous content of my old blogs. They were squarespace blog posts and I downloaded the blog files that Squarespace provides... it's an xml file that is a list of html files... if I wasn't a developer it would be extremely confusing and makes you feel like you don't own your content. I don't understand the decision they took, but it's clear it's a measure to prevent people from leaving the platform.

I'm going to manually strip out my content and create posts.

What I'm doing is taking the files, opening them in chrome, finding the html chunks and pasting them into a new file. The html chunks then are beautified by a IDE which then I'll translate to markdown, using a converter tool.

I initially exported these files in markdown... which is a little frustrating to be honest to be translating them back... I wish their system was better.
